### 1.What is the different between method and function?

> A method is on an object. (Tồn tại trên/trong một Object)

> A function is independent of an object. (Độc lập với các Object)

### 2.Method and Function in programming languages

> For C, there are only functions (because no OOP context in C)

> For C++ it would depend on whether or not you're in a class.

> For Ruby, there are only methods, because almost anything in Ruby is Object and when you define a "function" not blong to any object, actually it still exist in an "global object" (feeling matrix movie).

> For Js, existing both.
